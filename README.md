## Development Process

### Project Design and Methodologies

The project was designed with a focus on simplicity and ease of use. Key design considerations included:

Responsive Design: Ensuring the application is usable on various devices.
Modular Code: Writing clean, modular code to facilitate maintenance and future enhancements.
API Integration: Leveraging the SWAPI to dynamically fetch and display data.

## Unique Approaches

Dynamic Data Fetching: Implemented real-time data fetching using JavaScriptâ€™s fetch API to ensure the latest information is displayed.
Search Functionality: Enhanced the search functionality to work across multiple categories (planets, characters, starships) by querying the SWAPI endpoints dynamically.

## Known Issues

Pagination: The current implementation does not handle pagination. This could lead to incomplete data being displayed if the number of entities exceeds the API's response limit.
Error Handling: Basic error handling is implemented, but there could be edge cases where the application does not gracefully handle API failures or network issues.
